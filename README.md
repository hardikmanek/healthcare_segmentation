# healthcare_segmentation
A clustering model for segmentation of patients

Project Overview
The POC application is designed to provide insights into patient clusters based on various attributes such as age, billing amount, length of stay, and other demographic factors. Using this tool, healthcare providers can better understand and cater to the diverse needs of their patient population, ultimately improving service delivery and patient outcomes.

Key Features
Data-Driven Insights: Performed end-to-end ML model development, utilizing clustering algorithms to group patients with similar characteristics, providing actionable insights for personalized care plans.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface for healthcare professionals to interact with and interpret data.
Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for integration with larger datasets and additional features as required.
Deployment: The application is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud, ensuring easy access and demonstration capabilities.

Technical Highlights
Clustering Algorithm: Implemented K-Means clustering to identify patterns and group similar patient profiles.
Dimensionality Reduction: Utilized t-SNE for effective visualization of high-dimensional data.
Preprocessing: Employed data preprocessing techniques to ensure accuracy and reliability in model predictions.
